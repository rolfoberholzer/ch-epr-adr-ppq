# 2. Overview and relations among EPR policies and policy sets

Relations among EPR base policies, base policy sets, policy set templates, and user-defined policy sets generated from
these templates can be represented graphically in the following way (IDs of base policies and base policy sets are given
in a shortened form, without the common prefix `urn:e-health-suisse:2015:policies:`):

![Relations among EPR base policies, base policy sets, policy set templates, and user-defined policy sets generated from
these templates](policies.png)

Detailed descriptions of the elements of the EPR Official Policy Stack will be provided in the subsequent
sections. Target constraints of policies and policy sets will be represented as lists of allowed
document confidentiality codes, purposes of use, and user roles.

The following notational conventions apply:

* Asterisk `*` means that the target constraints do not address the corresponding attribute, i.e. that there is no
  restriction of its values.
* If a policy set references multiple policies or policy sets simultaneously, their IDs are separated by commas.
* If a policy set references a single policy or policy set from a list of alternatives, their IDs are separated by "or".
* If the target constraints of a policy set vary depending on which policies or policy sets it references, the syntax
  "ID of the referenced policy or policy set ðŸ¡’ resulting value" is used, e.g. "102 ðŸ¡’ `NORMAL`".
