# 3. Use Cases for Policy Set Templates

## 3.1. General remarks

1. During the onboarding of a patient, only the Policy Administrator can submit policy sets related to this patient.
After the onboarding, policy sets related to the patient can be submitted by the patient himself, 
by his representatives (if any), or by the Policy Administrator on behalf of the patient.  <br/><br/>
2. In the use case descriptions below, the statements "the patient wants", "the patient decides", etc. cover 
also situations when a representative (authorized by the means of a corresponding policy set) 
decides and acts on behalf of the patient.   <br/><br/>
3. A policy set can be updated either by an in-place modification (CH:PPQ-1 UpdatePolicy), or by
a deletion (CH:PPQ-1 DeletePolicy) followed by a resubmission (CH:PPQ-1 AddPolicy) of the policy set.
When modifying a policy set in-place, its ID and the EPR-SPID shall be not changed.    <br/><br/>
Healthcare professionals with the right to delegate permissions can perform only in-place modifications
of policy sets.   <br/><br/>
In regard to policy sets based on templates 301–304, and only when the patient 
(for policy sets based on template 301 — also a healthcare professional with the right to delegate permissions) 
wants to _broaden_ the permissions of a healthcare professional, a group of healthcare professionals, 
or a representative, i.e. to raise the confidentiality level of available documents or to extend the validity period,
the original policy set may be left untouched, and a new, additional policy set of the same type may be submitted.
The same is true for the prolongation of exclusion list memberships (a special flavor of policy sets based on template 301).   <br/><br/>
But it is nevertheless advisable to have at most one policy set for any given combination of template ID, EPR-SPID, 
and GLN/group OID/representative ID.   <br/><br/>
4. Putting a healthcare professional into the exclusion list (by submitting a corresponding policy set) 
will outpower all other policy sets applicable onto him.
